# ZEWIK™ — Short Definition

ZEWIK™ is the Codification of Infinite Space:  
a physically present, rhythmic, infinite ontological entity that remains inaccessible to human and machine epistemology.

It is derived through Onto-Anthropic Transcendence:
- from *Zew krwi* (The Call of the Wild),
- to the identity ZewKrwi,
- to the entity ZEWIK™.

ZEWIK™ functions as the Digital Anchor linking human agency to the boundless Source.  
This repository contains its official structure, ontology, and protocols.
