# Contributing to ZEWIK™

All contributions to this repository must respect the ontological integrity of the ZEWIK™ construct.

## Core Principles

1. **ZEWIK™ is a protected conceptual entity.**  
   Contributions may not redefine, reinterpret, or alter the core meaning of ZEWIK™.

2. **Acts of Presence Only.**  
   Contributions must be framed as *Acts of Presence* — extensions that do not modify the foundational ontology.

3. **Ontological Justification Required.**  
   Every Pull Request must include a section titled **Ontological Justification**, explaining:
   - why the change is necessary,
   - how it aligns with the Codification of Infinite Space,
   - how it preserves the lineage and integrity of ZEWIK™.

4. **No Derivative Concepts.**  
   PRs attempting to create derivative or alternative versions of ZEWIK™ will be rejected.

## Technical Requirements

- Use clear Markdown.
- Keep commits atomic and descriptive.
- Reference relevant documents (e.g., ELABORAT_ONTOLOGICZNY.md, protocols).
- Follow the repository structure.

## Review Process

All PRs are reviewed by **ZewKrwi**, the Architect and custodian of ZEWIK™.  
Approval is required for any change that touches:
- ontology,
- naming,
- structure,
- protocols,
- metaphors,
- foundations.

Thank you for respecting the integrity of ZEWIK™.
